      <p>Welcome to the study. Thank you for considering taking part; you are asked to carefully read the information on this page, which you may return to at any point.
 <strong> Please make sure you are using a device with a mouse or trackpad </strong> - 
        some parts of the experiment cannot register inputs from a touchscreen, and this will result in unusable data.</p>
      <p><br><em>What is it for?</em></p>
      <p>The purpose of this research study is to further our understanding of our automatic comprehension and response to different types of sentences. 
        This study is being conducted by student researcher Syni Stamouli with project supervisor Dr. Dominique Makowski at the University of Sussex. 
        If you have any questions, the researchers may be contacted at (ss2651@sussex.ac.uk)</p>

         <p><br><em>What does participation involve?</em></p>
      <p><br>This study uses an online experiment lasting approximately 25-35 minutes in full, with a break point around 12 minutes. Please make sure you are in a place where you can focus and not be interrupted. 
        Firstly, you will be asked a few questions about yourself and complete a survey. Then, instructions will be given to complete tasks involving responding 
        to particular statements by pressing different buttons according to a given rule. These statements will either be to do with Brexit or immigration in the UK.
       
                 <p><br><em>What does participation involve?</em></p>

        <br>None of the statements presented will be of an abusive or extreme nature. However, given the topic matter, 
        they may nonetheless be distressing for some people. Please consult <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/feelings-symptoms-behaviours/feelings-and-symptoms/stress/" target="_blank">this NHS webpage for resources to deal with distress</a>.
         This will also be presented midway and at the end. After completing the experiment, you will be given a link to a separate form to submit your email for the prize draw of a £25 retail voucher.
        <br>

                <p><br><em>What will happen to the results and the data?</em></p>
        
        <p><br>The results of this research will be included in a Master's dissertation, which we anticipate being  available from 01/09/25 (ss2651@sussex.ac.uk). In accordance with the principles of open science, the raw data will be publicly available. 
Please read this information carefully and then, if you wish to take part, please check the box below to show you have fully understood, and that you consent to take part in the study as it  is described. If you have any other questions about the experiment, 
you may send these to ss2651@sussex.ac.uk.<br>

Your participation in this study is completely voluntary and confidential; you may withdraw at any time.
Information from the prize draw form is entered and kept on a system entirely separate from the experimental data and is thus not connected to it. During the experiment, you will be given a random unique ID which you may make a note of. If at any point you change your mind about participating, until 25/08/2025 you may request that the data associated with this ID be deleted. 
You will be alerted when your data is saved; leaving the experiment before this point will be treated as a reversal of your decision to participate and your data will not be included in the final analysis
After the save point, you will be reminded of your user ID and the details of how to withdraw your data if you wish to do so.</p>
        
        <br>No identifying information will be collected in the experiment, meaning your answers will be anonymous and not traceable to you. 
        Information from the prize draw form is entered and kept on a system entirely separate from the experimental data and is thus
        not connected to it. During the experiment, you will be given a random unique ID which you may make a note of. If after the experiment 
        you change your mind about participating, at any point until 21/08/2025 you may request that the data associated with this ID be 
        deleted. You may also leave the experiment before the save point if you wish to reverse your decision to participate, in which case your data 
        will not be included in the final analysis and will be deleted. After the save point, information will be provided with details of how to
        withdraw your data if you wish to do so.</p>

        <p><br><em>Who can take part?</em></p>
        <p> To take part, you must be at least 18 years of age, speak English fluently, and either be British by nationality or currently reside in the UK (and have spent more than 12 months in the UK in total). You must be using
            a mouse or trackpad, and not a touchscreen, to input your answers. If you are currently using a touchscreen, please connect a
            mouse or switch to a different device. </p>

          <p><br>If you do not wish to complete this survey, simply close your browser. 
Your responses are only connected to information you provide within the experiment, and IP addresses will not be collected to ensure anonymity. Sensitive information, such as ethnicity, is voluntary to disclose and does not affect your participation in the experiment. You will not be asked for your name or location.
This project has been reviewed and approved by the University of Sussex. Questions concerning your rights as a participant in this research may be directed to ss2651@sussex.ac.uk.</p>

<p><br>Before you continue, ensure that you have understood the following:
        <ul><p><li><em>I understand that by checking the boxes to continue I am agreeing to take part in the University of Sussex research described here, and that I have read and understood this information sheet.</li></p>
      <p><li>I understand that my participation is entirely voluntary, that I can choose not to participate in part or all of the study, and that I can withdraw at any stage without having to give a reason and without being penalised in any way (e.g., if I am a student, my decision whether or not to take part will not affect my grades)
</li></p>
<p><li>I understand that my personal data will be used for the purposes of this research study and will be handled in accordance with Data Protection legislation. I understand that the University’s  <a href="https://www.sussex.ac.uk/about/website/privacy-and-cookies/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy Notice</a> provides further information on how the University uses personal data in its research.</li></p>
      <p><li>I understand I can request without penalty that my data be withdrawn and deleted even after the data collection is complete, any time up until the results are analysed (25/08/25).</em></li></p></ul>
